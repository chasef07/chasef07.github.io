            <h2> Saturday September 21st 2024, Clearwater, FL</h2>
            <p>I had an amazing week with my parents. It felt long but it also flew by. They were so helpful in helping me pack and unpack and get everything ready. I know it must be hard for them but I am very grateful for their love and support. I wake up at 5:30 am tomorrow for a flight to New York. In six hours starts the day I have been thinking and talking about for so long. The crazy thing is it has not really hit me yet. People have asked me “how do you feel?” “ are you excited?” And honestly I do not know how I feel. It just feels like another day which is good. I am not scared or anxious or excited or happy or sad. In the past when I would get excited for a trip the excitement is due to a break from your routine and making the most out of a two week vacation. Now this is my life for the foreseeable future. There are so many unknowns and I am forced to take it day by day and really be in the moment. That idea is exciting to me but I do not feel excited if that makes sense. 

                Being back home for the first time in 6 months made me realize how amazing it was to grow up in Florida. This week I went to the beach with my mom and went fishing with my dad. We ate fresh seafood and relaxed in nice weather all day long. Florida has a very unique flare and I am grateful to have been shaped by the people and the places here. The natural beauty is stunning and I never realized it until I left. So much wildlife like dolphins and stingrays and pelicans and deer that you don’t see on a daily basis elsewhere. 
                
                I am going to try and get some rest. I feel exhausted from the past two weeks of packing and unpacking and getting everything ready but it all comes down to tomorrow. I have a backpack on my back to show for all the work I put in. Looking forward to whatever may be.

            <h2>Sunday September 22nd 2024, New York, NY</h2>
            
            <p>I woke up at 5:30 am today to catch a 7:15 flight to New York. My dad drove me to the airport and we said our goodbyes. I got a window seat and slept the whole entire flight. Upon arriving to JFK I took the subway to the lower east side to grab brunch with my close camp friends Marley and Delila. We have been friends for over 13 years through camp and college. Friendships like those do not come often and I really value all our memories and times together. In the subway I was reminded how much I dislike New York. A guy was screaming bible verses and proselytizing Jesus and then a huge lady sat next to me squeezing me into the railing. She smelled like cigarettes. Also a homeless lady came asking for money. It was really sad seeing how everyone did not even treat her as a human being. How have we let society get to a place where we value human life so little? I nicely told her I did not have anything and she appreciated the acknowledgment. She also told me she had seen me before. The subway took two hours and I arrived to brunch late. We ate at potluck club and it was pretty good. After that I went to Public hotel to work on my blog. I put in a good shift and released it to the public. Then I got a bagel from Tompkins square bagel which was pretty yummy. It was the equinox today so it was required of me to lay in the grass. I found a local park and sat there and FaceTimed Ron and Zach. The grass was pretty poor and un comfy but it was nice being outside. The weather was great, that was about the only good thing about the city. Also people dressed very fashionably which was cool and there was so many different types of people. I could see how New York was once a prosperous place but it is just not it now. It’s dirty and smelly and expensive. Finally I went to back to the airport to catch my flight to Rome. I’m pretty exhausted from a really long day and I hope to sleep some on the flight. I think I have a middle seat which sucks but I’m so tired I think I will make do. </p>

            <h2>Monday September 23rd 2024, Rome, Italy</h2>
            
            <p>I slept a good amount on the plane. I did have a middle seat but there was nobody to my left so I got to scoot over! I think sitting in a plane for that long takes years off your life span. My spine was so compressed and I woke up in pain in my neck and back and legs. I’m happy with the amount I slept but unhappy with how much pain it causes. My favorite part of all long haul flights is mid flight stretchies. This is when you stand up walk to an open area and do a full yoga flow. It usually draws eyes but who’s laughing now? The people with scoliosis or being yoga limber and increasing your life span? I realized I had a 7 hour layover in Rome and rushed to the train. I caught the train at 15:08 and took it to the coliseum I had to get off the train and transfer to the metro. As I got off the bustling train a thought occurred to me. Taking the public transport in a foreign country and foreign language really helps develop neural plasticity and problem solving skills. In the ten minutes since getting off the train I had to take in vast amount of information and quickly figure out my way while also watching out. This mental exercise I believe is very beneficial for young minds. It’s a Monday and I “should be” working in an office. However it’s funny I’ve used my brain 10x more in the past ten minutes adapting and problem solving than I had as an electrical engineer for two years. I got to the coliseum and it was pretty cool. Walking through such old history really puts the timeline of human existence into perspective. Rome is cool in the sense that it’s a modern city just scattered with ancient ruins. It kinda reminds me of the old city of Jerusalem. Next I wandered the streets more and made it to the famous fountain. This was probably my favorite site. It was really beautiful and in pristine condition. There were so many tourists though. Next I walked to the pantheon took a pic and was ready to eat. I had a beer and water and chips at a restaurant in a nice plaza. At this time when I just sat back and relaxed I realized that this is awesome! I then got amazing kinder and Oreo gelato for 3 euros. I felt it was a must to have pasta so I finally ate cacio e Pepe at a place. Honestly I did not think I would be able to leave the airport let alone explore Rome fully. I made my way back to the train station. Note I did this all without phone connection which I was pretty happy about. I used the maps and spatial awareness to get me to and from the places I needed. At the airport I got grilled pretty hard by the El Al security guy. He did his job diligently and it was fun getting questioned. I’m waiting for my flight to the Holy Land now!</p>
