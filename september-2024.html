            <h2> Saturday September 21st 2024, Clearwater, FL</h2>
            <p>I had an amazing week with my parents. It felt long but it also flew by. They were so helpful in helping me pack and unpack and get everything ready. I know it must be hard for them but I am very grateful for their love and support. I wake up at 5:30 am tomorrow for a flight to New York. In six hours starts the day I have been thinking and talking about for so long. The crazy thing is it has not really hit me yet. People have asked me “how do you feel?” “ are you excited?” And honestly I do not know how I feel. It just feels like another day which is good. I am not scared or anxious or excited or happy or sad. In the past when I would get excited for a trip the excitement is due to a break from your routine and making the most out of a two week vacation. Now this is my life for the foreseeable future. There are so many unknowns and I am forced to take it day by day and really be in the moment. That idea is exciting to me but I do not feel excited if that makes sense. 

                Being back home for the first time in 6 months made me realize how amazing it was to grow up in Florida. This week I went to the beach with my mom and went fishing with my dad. We ate fresh seafood and relaxed in nice weather all day long. Florida has a very unique flare and I am grateful to have been shaped by the people and the places here. The natural beauty is stunning and I never realized it until I left. So much wildlife like dolphins and stingrays and pelicans and deer that you don’t see on a daily basis elsewhere. 
                
                I am going to try and get some rest. I feel exhausted from the past two weeks of packing and unpacking and getting everything ready but it all comes down to tomorrow. I have a backpack on my back to show for all the work I put in. Looking forward to whatever may
